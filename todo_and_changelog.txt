To be implemented:
  x inventory
  x powerup time
  x help on loader/big_play_button


Bugs... or features? :D
  x sounds might get played regardless the muting state (master volume?!)
  - sounds get out of sync on some browsers
  x on IE and Opera the "Play!" button is not aligned to the center
  x the music is not yet FlashBlock compatible if the Flash version must be used
  x sometimes the music/sounds won't start after the "Play!" button pressed // the change of body.style.overflowY caused the problem on pause/unpause
  x IE BUG: stack overflow of using  bindAsEventListener of prototype.js on _reload_ (!) - changed to window.setTimeout()
  x IE BUG: Object.keys() of prototype.js is not working - created _keys()
  - ColorScroller does not choose the shortest scrolling direction of hue
  x single key shortcuts (on Opera) gets executed on 1-2-3 keys... ("kill the bubbling!")
  x flashblock compatibility
